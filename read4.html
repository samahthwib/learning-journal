     before  you start building your website you should check and answer some questions: 
     
1-Who is the Site For? This is very important , when you creat the website you should know the people you expected to be interested in the subject of your site <br>
2- Why People Visit YOUR Website?<br>
3- What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?<br>
4- What Information Your Visitors Need ?<br>
5- How Often People Will Visit Your Site?<br>
 now itâ€™s the time to build your site map to organize the information <br>
  *WireFrames* <br>
 A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require
 Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
