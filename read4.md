1-Who is the Site For? This is very important , when you creat the website you should know the people you expected to be interested in the subject of your site
2- Why People Visit YOUR Website?
3- What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
4- What Information Your Visitors Need ?
5- How Often People Will Visit Your Site?
#### now itâ€™s the time to build your site map to organize the information
  *WireFrames*
#### A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
#### Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
